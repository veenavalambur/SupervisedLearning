Analysis of used and new cell phone data to predict prices of used cell phones using supervised learning methods

Context
Buying and selling used smartphones used to be something that happened on a handful of online marketplace sites. But the used and refurbished phone market has grown considerably over the past decade, and a new IDC (International Data Corporation) forecast predicts that the used phone market would be worth $52.7bn by 2023 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% from 2018 to 2023. This growth can be attributed to an uptick in demand for used smartphones that offer considerable savings compared with new models.

Refurbished and used devices continue to provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing a smartphone. There are plenty of other benefits associated with the used smartphone market. Used and refurbished devices can be sold with warranties and can also be insured with proof of purchase. Third-party vendors/platforms, such as Verizon, Amazon, etc., provide attractive offers to customers for refurbished smartphones. Maximizing the longevity of mobile phones through second-hand trade also reduces their environmental impact and helps in recycling and reducing waste. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may further boost the cheaper refurbished smartphone segment, as consumers cut back on discretionary spending and buy phones only for immediate needs.
